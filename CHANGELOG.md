# Changelog

## 0.0.2

- Added **LLM: Select Model** command to let you pick which VS Code-hosted model should handle prompts.
- Remember the last selected model and reuse it for future prompts, with a quick pick fallback when multiple models are available.
- Added npm scripts `package:vsix` and `install:vsix` plus a helper installer to streamline packaging and installing the extension locally.

## 0.0.1

- Initial release with the `LLM: Send Prompt` command that forwards user input to the built-in VS Code language model API.
